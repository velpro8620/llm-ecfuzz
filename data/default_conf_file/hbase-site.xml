OVERVIEW

The important configs. are listed near the top.  You should change
at least the setting for hbase.tmp.dir.  Other settings will change
dependent on whether you are running hbase in standalone mode or
distributed.  See the hbase reference guide for requirements and
guidance making configuration.

This file does not contain all possible configurations.  The file would be
much larger if it carried everything. The absent configurations will only be
found through source code reading.  The idea is that such configurations are
exotic and only those who would go to the trouble of reading a particular
section in the code would be knowledgeable or invested enough in ever wanting
to alter such configurations, so we do not list them here.  Listing all
possible configurations would overwhelm and obscure the important.

  <property>
    <name>hbase.rootdir</name>
    <value>/home/hadoop/hbase-2.2.2-work/hbase-tmp</value>
    <description>The directory shared by region servers and into
    which HBase persists.  The URL should be 'fully-qualified'
    to include the filesystem scheme.  For example, to specify the
    HDFS directory '/hbase' where the HDFS instance's namenode is
    running at namenode.example.org on port 9000, set this value to:
    hdfs://namenode.example.org:9000/hbase.  By default, we write
    to whatever ${hbase.tmp.dir} is set too -- usually /tmp --
    so change this configuration or else all data will be lost on
    machine restart.</description>
